<h4>Rome, The Eternal City</h4>
<h5><em>Arrive Tuesday October 23rd, Depart Wednesday October 24th.</em></h5>

<p>Our journey begins in Rome, the center of the Western world for dozens of centuries. We will only have a brief stay in Rome, arriving mid-day one day and boarding our ship the next.</p>

<p>Regent has booked us into the <a href="http://www.intercontinental.com/intercontinental/en/gb/locations/romha?sicreative=14859359100&dp=true&sicontent=0&sitrackingid=443460787&siclientid=1911">Intercontinental De La Ville Roma</a> hotel, located near the Spanish Steps.</p>
<p>Their website says, "A 17TH CENTURY BUILDING OVERLOOKING SPANISH STEPS   There’s no better place to begin your Eternal City experience than InterContinental De La Ville Roma. Our location at the top of the Spanish Steps is the ideal base for shopping, sightseeing and attending cultural events. Within a short radius are Trevi Fountain, the Colosseum, Via Condotti, Piazza di Spagna and the Borghese Gallery and Museum."</p>

<p>Given the location, walking to the Spanish Steps and environs would make sense. Reservations at the <a href="http://www.galleriaborghese.it/borghese/en/edefault.htm">Borghese Gallery</a> would be good as well.</p>

<p>Our ship leaves from the port city of Civitavecchia which is about 80 km (90 min.) west-northwest of Rome. Originally built by Emperor Trajan at the beginning of the 2nd Century AD, it has been modernized to handle large cruise ships and ferrys.</p>
