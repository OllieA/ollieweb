<p>Istanbul is the third largest city in Europe (behind London and Moscow) and is the cultural and economic center of Turkey. It spans the Straits of Bosphorus, this making it the only metropolis in the world that is situated on two continents (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul">Wikipedia article</a> for lots more).</p>

<br />Istanbul's districts extend far from the city center along <br />the full length of the Bosphorus (with the Black Sea at top <br />and the Sea of Marmara at bottom).</div>
<p>It is an ancient city, known by the Greeks as Byzantium. Constantine made it the capitol of Rome, leading to the name Constantinople. It became the capitol of the Ottoman Empire following the fall of the Byzantine empire to the Ottomans in 1453. Only after establishment of modern Turkey in the 20th Century did it officially change name to Istanbul.</p>

<p>The NY Times maintains a <a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/turkey/istanbul/overview.html?inline=nyt-geo">travel guide to Istanbul</a>, amongst other destinations with numerous articles and suggestions for sightseeing, dining and shopping. Here is a beautiful-looking spot they recommended, <a href="http://www.perapalace.com/en-EN/agatha--restaurant/91.aspx">the Agatha Restaurant</a>, said to be the spot Agatha Christie penned <em>The Orient Express</em>.

<h4>Dining</h4>
<p>The NY Times has had a number of articles about Istanbul dining recently, including <a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/travel/tasting-humble-and-high-cuisine-in-istanbul.html?seid=auto&smid=tw-nytimestravel">Tasting Istanbul, From Humble to High Cuisine</a> (September 30. 2011)</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal ran a page entitled <strong><em>Foreign Flavors: Culinary adventures add a little spice to a vacation</em></strong> on 10/8/11. In it was the following passage about Istanbul:</p>

Perched at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, Istanbul boasts a cuisine infused with flavors derived from the far reaches of the Ottoman Empire. Sadly, the guilds of Ottoman-era cooks kept their processes secret, so few recipes survive to this day. That's why you must seek out <a href="http://www.kempinski.com/en/istanbul/Restaurants%20and%20Bars/Restaurants/Pages/TugraRestaurant.aspx">Tugra at the Ciagan Palace</a>. Here amid sultanesque d&eacute;cor and fabulous Bosporus views, culinary genius Ugur Alparslan recreates recipes found in the Topkapi Palace libraries -- the menu includes dolma (stuffed vegetable shells), lebeniye (sour lentil) soup and wild sea bass kulbasti, followed by an endless parade of sweet little pastries including Turkish delight, said to have been invented in the 19th century to please Sultan Abdul Hamid's harem. </div>

<p>To see how Turkish fare has evolved since Ottoman Rule, embark on a tasting tour of Istanbul's lively backstreets with <a href="http://istanbuleats.com/">Istanbul Eats</a>: you'll sample such delights as midye tava (fried stuffed mussels), chicken breast pudding and Kurdish pit-roasted lamb, all the while enjoying unique insights into the history and traditions of Turkish cuisine.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the website <a href="http://istanbuleats.com/">Istanbul Eats</a> ("a serious eater's guide to the city") is filled with tips on exotic dining all over Istanbul, including walking tours .</p>

<p>Sue found <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g293974-Istanbul.html">TripAdvisor's Istanbul Retaurants page</a> and particularly like #1, #5 and #7. The first one, <a href="http://www.metropolisrestaurant.net/">Metropolis Restaurant</a> is in the old part of the city. Its menu sounds terrific. The second, <a href="http://www.imbatrestaurant.com/">Imbat Restaurant</a> is also in the old city and is said to have very nice views of the city in addition to an extensive menu. Many traditional dishes covering meats and fishes. Sue's final choice is <a href="http://www.alburakathisma.com/main_en/">Albura Kathisma</a>. Again located in the old city, they offer a very extensive seafood and Turkish menu.</p>
<p>Here is another site she found: <a href="http://www.turkeytourspecialist.com/blog/view/fine-dining-in-turkey">Fine Dining in Turkey</a>. This page discusses Turkish dining and recommends 10 different restaurants.</p>

<h4>Magical Istanbul</h4>
<p>Sue found a wonderful 50 minute long video in HD	about many of the sites we plan to visit. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvr6K02dglc&feature=youtube_gdata_player">The video, entitled <em>Magical Istanbul</em></a> is well worth seeing.</p>
	
<h4>Shopping</h4>

<p>This will be quite a list, ranging from exotic and historic to quite contemporary. Again, the NY Times leads off with a blog posting, <a href="http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/istanbul-reimagined/?seid=auto&smid=tw-nytimestravel">Istanbul Reimagined</a>.

<p>One thing that looks quite interesting is a <a href="http://www.bosphorustour.com/Bosphorus-Cruise-GoldenHorn.html">cruise on the Bosphorus</a>.
